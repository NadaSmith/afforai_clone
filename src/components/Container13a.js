                                        I've signed up and starting testing Afforai Ask for my next project's business model, and I have had a great experience so far. It has been exactly what I needed with its fast response times. For now, I am considering purchasing the Afforai - Lite Plan.

                                        Great tool for text analysis and emphasizing the main idea of a document. Especially when you need a quick answer without tones of epithets that beautifully describe something that can be actually described in a few words:)

                                        This looks good to ease out the data analysis task for the users. But in the Affroi build guide, I couldn't see how efficiently the data analysis is done. Guess I have to take a subscription for it. The product looks great and has a User-friendly interface. Congrats on the launch.
